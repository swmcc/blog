# swmcc.github.com 

Produced using [jekyll-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap). The quickest way to start and publish your Jekyll powered blog. 100% compatible with [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com).

## Here's the dealio

I have had several blogs in certain states of disarray since 2000. [Tom Preston Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com) [talks](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com/blob/master/README.textile) about why he uses github to host his blog. I agree since I can count at least seven iterations of blogs that I have had.

Luckily I have been able to get most of what I wrote back in some shape or format. So as time allows I will go through my archives and post old enteries here. The blog on my [site](http://swm.cc) will still point to [wordress](http://swmcc.wordpress.com) until the migration is complete. I hope that this process will be complete come the start of 2013. So watch this space. I will then point blog.swm.cc to come here.

## Update

As of 22nd November 2012 blog.swm.cc now points here. I have updated the two last enteries on the wordpress site to be here and made sure I am happy enough with the formatting. Some images in the blog posts don't exist but I am not too worried.

## TODO

- Add entries remaining enteries from 2002-2009
- Amend enteries to have categories
