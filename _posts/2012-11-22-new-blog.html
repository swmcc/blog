<p>I have had several blogs in certain states of disarray since 2000. <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com">Tom Preston Werner</a> <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">talks</a> about why he uses <a href="http://www.github.com">github</a> to host his blog. I agree since I can count at least seven iterations of blogs that I have had.</p>
