A quick list of how I have spent the last ten years on NYE. It is not a time I relish, in fact I would go as far as to say I hate it!

<strong>2000</strong> – Spent it Portstewart – everyone fought and had a really shit time. Slept in a phonebox at the big filling station. Long story <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<strong>2001</strong> – Spent it in Richies Hillsborough had so much Baileys Cream that I ended up getting the taxi man to stop en route home and I puked it all up. To this day I cannot even bear the smell of it.

<strong>2002</strong> – Spent in The Plough Hillsborough had a rotten night mainly cos I thought at 23 I was getting too old for this NYE crap. Ended up saying something nasty to someone and spent most of the night (until 4am) trying to backtrack from sounding like a complete bastard! I actually just remembered that last part.. That was bad, funny now though <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<strong>2003</strong> – Spent at home watched The Green Mile, The Mummy and another film I cannot remember. Went over to the parents to see in the New Year.

<strong>2004 </strong>- Same as above – cannot remember the actual films though.

<strong>2005</strong> – Same as above – cannot remember the actual films though.

<strong>2006</strong> – Went to the Down Royal but only in the afternoon. Came home rather drunk – had a chinese and was so drunk I fell asleep at 11 <img src="../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<strong>2007</strong> – Spent it at  home.

<strong>2008 </strong>- McGeowns in Glenavy. No one there – came back home and spent it with the parents.

<strong>2009</strong> – Went to Moffett’s… Was good craic – came home and annoyed the parents to stupid oclock!

<strong>2010</strong> – Staying in. Not going too far since CC and I are both dying with the cold.

Aye, I hate NYE… Stupid non holiday.
